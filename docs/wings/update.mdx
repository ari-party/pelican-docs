# Updating Wings

Updating Wings is a painless process and should take less than a minute to complete.

<Admonition type="tip">
    Running servers **will not** be affected.
</Admonition>

## Standard Update

### Version Requirements

Each version of Wings also has a corresponding minimum version of the Pelican Panel that is required for it to run.

Please see the chart below for how these versions line up. In most cases your base Panel version should match that of your Wings.

| Panel Version | Wings Version | Supported |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:---------:|
|1.0.0+         | 1.0.0+        |     ✅︎  |

<Admonition type="warning">
   If you are updating from < 1.0.0-beta9. This won't work!

   If you do not wish to use the update command and wish to do it manually, then follow the [manual update](#manual-update) process below.
</Admonition>

```sh
sudo wings update
sudo systemctl restart wings
```
